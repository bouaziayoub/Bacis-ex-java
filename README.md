The GitHub repository contains two Java classes: "alumnos" and "billets_machine," each representing a distinct application.

1. **Class "alumnos":**
   This Java program is designed to manage and analyze student data within a classroom setting. It collects information about the ages of students and performs various analyses on this data. Key features of this class include:
   - **Data Collection:** It collects the ages of students within the classroom.
   - **Data Analysis:** It calculates important metrics such as the total age and average age of the group.
   - **Identification of Unique Ages:** It identifies unique ages present among the students.
   - **Counting Students at Each Age:** It counts the number of students at each age level.

2. **Class "billets_machine":**
   This Java program serves as a simulation of a ticket vending machine for public transportation. It offers users flexibility in selecting the type of ticket and the travel zone, accurately calculating costs associated with each purchase. Key features of this class include:
   - **Ticket Selection:** It allows users to choose from various ticket options.
   - **Zone Selection:** It enables users to select the travel zone for their journey.
   - **Cost Calculation:** It accurately calculates the total cost based on the chosen ticket type and travel zone.
   - **Payment Options:** It provides options for users to make payments for their selected tickets.

Both classes are designed to provide specific functionalities: one for managing student data and performing analyses, and the other for simulating a ticket vending machine for public transportation, catering to the needs of different applications or scenarios. These classes can be utilized as standalone components within larger Java applications or systems.
